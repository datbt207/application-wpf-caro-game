# BUILDING APPLICATION ON WINDOWS OPEARATING SYSTEM

## INTRODUCE
WPF, short for Windows Presentation Foundation, is a new API system that supports building graphical interfaces on the Windows platform.

WPF can also be called a GUI framework. It was born after Winform and has many changes in all aspects.

Considered the next generation of WinForms, WPF enhances the programmer's interface programming capabilities by providing APIs
that allow to take advantage of modern multimedia.

## DEVELOPMENT DIRECTION

The most obvious, important difference between WinForms and WPF is that while WinForms is simply a class based on standard Windows Controls (e.g. TextBox). But with WPF being built from the ground up and not relying on standard Windows controls in most situations.

Here are the main advantages of WPF and WinForms. It will give you a better idea of what you are doing.

Advantages of WPF:

- It is newer and therefore more in line with current standards.
- Microsoft is using it for a lot of new applications e.g. Visual Studio
- It's more flexible, can do more without having to write or buy new controls.
- When you need to use 3rd party controls, the developers of these controls will probably focus more on WPF because it's newer.
- XAML makes it easy to create and edit your GUI and allows work to be split between a designer (XAML) and a programmer (C#, VB.NET, etc.)
- Databinding, which allows you to have more separation between data and layout.
- Use hardware acceleration to draw GUI, for better performance.
- It allows you to create user interfaces for both Windows applications and web applications (Silverlight/XBAP)

## CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

To understand the Wpf programming job market, you must first understand what WPF is. WPF is an abbreviation of the full English phrase "Windows Presentation Foundation", this is a platform that allows programmers to create applications based on the .Net Framework, used on the operating system. windows.

Currently, the recruitment market for Wpf programmers for .Net is really a lot, businesses are constantly recruiting to find IT talent to serve the job in the most effective way.
